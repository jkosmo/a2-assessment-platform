# API Reference

All `/api/*` routes require authentication. In local/test `AUTH_MODE=mock`, use the `x-user-roles` header to set roles. Shared Azure environments must use `AUTH_MODE=entra`, where a valid JWT is required and mock identity headers are ignored.

## Source of truth

Route-group role requirements are defined in `API_ROUTE_CAPABILITIES` in `src/config/capabilities.ts`.
`app.ts` enforces them via `rolesFor(id)`. The per-route-group role columns in this document are derived
from that catalog — if the code and this doc disagree, the code wins.

**Exception:** `/api/calibration` is the only route whose access roles are not in `API_ROUTE_CAPABILITIES`.
They are runtime-configurable via `calibrationWorkspace.accessRoles` in `config/participant-console.json`.
See the calibration section below and the documented exception in `src/config/capabilities.ts`.

Workspace navigation follows the same contract; roles are exposed to the frontend through `/participant/config`.
See [DOMAIN_LIFECYCLE.md](DOMAIN_LIFECYCLE.md) for the full ownership model.

#### Module assessment mode (`assessmentMode`) — #525/#578

`POST .../module-versions` accepts an optional `assessmentMode`:

- `FREETEXT_PLUS_MCQ` (default when omitted) — requires `taskText`, `rubricVersionId` and
  `promptTemplateVersionId` (free-text submission graded by the LLM) plus `mcqSetVersionId`.
- `MCQ_ONLY` — no free-text/LLM evaluation. `taskText`, `rubricVersionId` and
  `promptTemplateVersionId` are omitted; only `mcqSetVersionId` is required. Pass/fail is decided
  purely by the MCQ score against a threshold (`assessmentPolicy.passRules.mcqMinPercent`,
  default **70%**).
- `FREETEXT_ONLY` (#578) — free-text submission graded by the LLM, **no MCQ**. Requires `taskText`,
  `rubricVersionId` and `promptTemplateVersionId`; `mcqSetVersionId` is omitted. The rubric/practical
  score spans the full **0–100** (no MCQ band) and there is no MCQ gate. Red-flag / manual-review
  routing applies as for FREETEXT_PLUS_MCQ. The assessment runs on the free-text submission directly
  (no MCQ step). Export/import omit the MCQ set (`activeVersion.mcqSet` is `null`).

**Certification invariant (#476/#525):** a course completion / certificate is issued only when a
participant has **passed all modules** in the course **and read all learning sections**. This is
re-checked both when a module is passed and when a section is marked read.
| `GET` | `/api/admin/content/modules/:moduleId/export` | ADMINISTRATOR, SUBJECT_MATTER_OWNER |
| `DELETE` | `/api/admin/content/modules/:moduleId` | ADMINISTRATOR, SUBJECT_MATTER_OWNER |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/generate/module-draft` | ADMINISTRATOR, SUBJECT_MATTER_OWNER |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/generate/mcq` | ADMINISTRATOR, SUBJECT_MATTER_OWNER |

#### Source-material ingest (#454/#479)

The conversational authoring "source" step turns files, URLs and pasted notes into source
material for draft generation. All routes use the `admin_content` capability.

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/source-material/extract` | Upload a file (base64 JSON) → async parse job. Per-file cap **10 MB** (#479 Slice A); this route alone accepts a 16 MB JSON body. |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/content/source-material/extract/:jobId` | Poll parse-job status (`pending`/`done`/`failed`). On `done`: `{ extractedText, fileName, format, extractedChars, lowTextDensity }`. **#601 Fase 1:** `lowTextDensity=true` flags an image-heavy / sparse-text upload so the author is warned the module would be thin. |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/source-material/fetch-url` | Fetch a single URL (HTML→Readability / `text/plain`) → main text. SSRF-protected; 10/min per user. Body `{ url }`. |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/source-material/crawl-url` | **#479 Slice B.** Crawl a start URL: same-hostname only, ≤20 pages, ≤2 hops, honouring `robots.txt`, 300 ms politeness delay. Each page is independently SSRF-revalidated and byte-capped. **3/min per user.** Body `{ url }` → `{ startHostname, pages: [{ url, title, extractedText, fetchedBytes }], pagesCrawled, pagesSkipped, totalBytes, truncated }`. `422 crawl_empty` if nothing could be crawled. |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/source-material/condense` | LLM-condense combined source material when it exceeds ~50K chars. |

---

## Admin - Courses & Learning Sections

All routes use the `admin_content` capability: ADMINISTRATOR, SUBJECT_MATTER_OWNER. Localized
fields (`title`, `bodyMarkdown`) accept a string or a partial `{en-GB,nb,nn}` object.

### Courses

| Method | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/admin/content/courses` | List courses (with module count) |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/courses` | Create a course |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/content/courses/:courseId` | Course detail (modules) |
| `PUT` | `/api/admin/content/courses/:courseId` | Update course metadata |
| `PUT` | `/api/admin/content/courses/:courseId/modules` | Set module list (legacy; dual-writes CourseItem) |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/content/courses/:courseId/items` | Read the ordered mixed module/section sequence (#486/B2) |
| `PUT` | `/api/admin/content/courses/:courseId/items` | Set the ordered sequence — body `{ items: [{type:"MODULE",moduleId} \| {type:"SECTION",sectionId}] }`. Re-syncs CourseModule (#486). |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/courses/:courseId/publish` | Publish course |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/courses/:courseId/archive` | Archive course |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/courses/:courseId/localize-copy` | LLM-translate course title/description |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/content/courses/:courseId/export-package` | Export envelope (inlines modules **and** sections in order, #512) |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/courses/import` | Import a course envelope (recreates sections via `items`, falls back to modules-only v1) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/admin/content/courses/:courseId` | Delete course |

### Learning sections (#476)

| Method | Route | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/sections` | Create a section (`title` + `bodyMarkdown`) → section + version 1 |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/content/sections` | List sections |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/content/sections/:sectionId` | Section detail (active version's `bodyMarkdown`) |
| `PATCH` | `/api/admin/content/sections/:sectionId/title` | Update title |
| `PUT` | `/api/admin/content/sections/:sectionId/content` | Publish a new immutable content version (latest-wins) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/admin/content/sections/:sectionId` | Delete (blocked `400` if the section is used in a course) |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/sections/preview` | Render markdown → sanitised HTML (same F3/X1 policy as participant view) |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/content/sections/localize` | LLM-translate title + bodyMarkdown to another locale (markdown-preserving). Rate-limited. |

## Admin - Modules

| Method | Route | Role(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/admin/modules` | ADMINISTRATOR, SUBJECT_MATTER_OWNER |

---

## Admin - Platform

| Method | Route | Role(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/admin/platform` | ADMINISTRATOR — includes `certificateBackground: boolean` (#580) |
| `PUT` | `/api/admin/platform` | ADMINISTRATOR |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/platform/certificate-background` | ADMINISTRATOR — multipart `file` (PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP, max 15 MB). Sets the platform-wide diploma background (#580). |
| `DELETE` | `/api/admin/platform/certificate-background` | ADMINISTRATOR — clears the diploma background (#580). |

**Certificate background image (#580):** the uploaded image is stored in blob (reusing F4 asset
storage) and referenced from platform key-value config — no new model. It is served
**unauthenticated** at `GET /certificate-background` (a non-sensitive branding image; `404` when
none is set), so the certificate page's CSS background and the admin preview `<img>` can load it
without auth headers. `GET /api/courses/completions/:certificateId` returns
`certificateBackgroundUrl` (`/certificate-background` or `null`).

---

## Admin - Org Sync

| Method | Route | Role(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/admin/sync/org` | ADMINISTRATOR |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/sync/org/delta` | ADMINISTRATOR |

---

## Workspace UIs

Static workspace pages are served from `public/`.
These URLs are not role-gated by Express itself; access is enforced by the authenticated API calls each page makes, and navigation visibility comes from the canonical capability contract exposed through `/participant/config`.

| URL | Primary capability roles |
|---|---|
| `/participant` | PARTICIPANT, ADMINISTRATOR, REVIEWER |
| `/participant/completed` | PARTICIPANT, ADMINISTRATOR, REVIEWER |
| `/review` | REVIEWER, APPEAL_HANDLER, ADMINISTRATOR |
| `/calibration` | Runtime-configurable via `calibrationWorkspace.accessRoles` (default SUBJECT_MATTER_OWNER, ADMINISTRATOR) |
| `/admin-content` | SUBJECT_MATTER_OWNER, ADMINISTRATOR |
| `/admin-content/courses` (+ `/courses/new`, `/courses/:id`) | SUBJECT_MATTER_OWNER, ADMINISTRATOR |
| `/admin-content/sections` | SUBJECT_MATTER_OWNER, ADMINISTRATOR |
| `/results` | SUBJECT_MATTER_OWNER, ADMINISTRATOR, REPORT_READER |
| `/profile` | any authenticated |
| `/admin-platform` | ADMINISTRATOR |
